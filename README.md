# WiFiTrace
Network-centric WiFi Contact Tracing

WiFiTrace is a network-centric contact tracing method that uses enterprise WiFi networks for contact tracing in office and campus settings.  Unlike bluetooth-based methods, it does not require an app to be installed on user phones and instead uses syslog data generated by enterprise WiFi access points to trace locations within office/campus buildings that an infected user has visited. It can also report other users who were seen for a period of time near those access points.

The tool and algorithm leverages our prior expertise in modeling mobile trajectories to efficiently perform these computations on syslog WiFi data.
